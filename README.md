<h3>Key points:</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
  <li>This was made to be used on phones not computers. It will look really weird on devices with big screens. 😂</li><br>
  <li>The certificate is dynamic, meaning you can bookmark the certificate & it will always be a new certificate. 😲</li><br>
  <li>You can change your status from <b>GUEST</b> to <b>STUDENT</b> or <b>DOE EMPLOYEE</b> by clicking it. It will save automatically to that stat &<br> turn it into your default. 😉</li><br>
  <li>This removes the need to constantly repeat the same repetitive task of clicking <b>No</b> a bunch of times. 🙌</li><br>
  <li>Please make sure to use this only if you are sure that you would've answered <b>No</b> <br>to all the questions on the actual Health Screening. ⚠️</li><br>
  <li>You can also edit the details such as the name, date and time whenever you like, just click on them. ✏</li><br>
  <li>Fun little easter egg. Clicking the profile picture 3 times allows you to change it. 😉</li><br>
  <li>If you have any issues or recommendations please contact me 😁</li><br>
